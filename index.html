        <p>
          Hello everybody, my name is Kyle. I'm 35, yes that means I'm an 80's
          kid <strong>deal with it.</strong> I was a military brat, I joined the
          Army straight out of high school as well. I've lived all over the
          world and had <mark> many, MANY adventures.</mark> Not all of which
          were fun, but all of which were worth it. I started off as a crewchief
          on Chinooks
          <sup

          >
          for the first five years of my career. I was stationed in Giebelstadt,
          Germany then Fort Riley, Kansas with the Big Red One (1st ID). We all
          piled onto the short bus for a field trip to Tikrit, Iraq. When I
          returned stateside I transferred to <del>Military Intellegence</del
          ><sub>(such a thing does not exist)</sub>. I had a lovely vacation in
          balmy Monterey, Ca learning Arabic before being forced on to Augusta,
          Ga.

          After the military I came back home to Knoxville, TN and took on work
          doing heavy aircraft maintenance for
          <a href="https://www.expressjet.com/"><i>ExpressJet Airlines</i></a
          >. I topped out in that industry for an aviation mechanic. To make any
          more I would have to take a higher position and move from the
          Knoxville area, and my family is here. After eight years, covid
          eventually hit the airlines & caused the company to downsize, our
          entire hangar in Knox was closed down.
          <b>Very few airlines have been hiring since,</b> and I believe
          software engineering & data science are the future of first-world
          economies. My ultimate goal is a bachelor's and disgustingly high
          paying job at
          <a href="https://g.co/kgs/w2A7wD" target="_blank"
            >Y-12 National Laboratories.</a

          Uncle Sam is highly sus, but he's sure got deep pockets!
